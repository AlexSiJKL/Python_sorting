# Sorting Algorithms

## bubble_sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## heap_sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.

## insertion_sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array (or list) one element at a time.

## merge_sort
Merge sort is an efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

## selection_sort +
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
